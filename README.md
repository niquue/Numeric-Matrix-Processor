# Numeric-Matrix-Processor

This is a project written in Python that allows users to do different types of arithmetic operations on matrices. These operations include addition, multiplication,
determinant, and inverse matrices. Similar to the teachings of linear algebra, this program takes those fundamentals to produce the calculations and outputs the results
to the user.

- In mathematics, particularly in linear algebra, matrix multiplication is a binary operation that produces a matrix from two matrices. For matrix multiplication, the number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix. The resulting matrix, known as the matrix product, has the number of rows of the first and the number of columns of the second matrix.

Matrix multiplication was first described by the French mathematician Jacques Philippe Marie Binet in 1812,[3] to represent the composition of linear maps that are represented by matrices. Matrix multiplication is thus a basic tool of linear algebra, and as such has numerous applications in many areas of mathematics, as well as in applied mathematics, statistics, physics, economics, and engineering.[4][5] Computing matrix products is a central operation in all computational applications of linear algebra.

This project also makes use of recursion in calculation of the matrices so the output is done in a timely fashion.

## Linear Algebra
- Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning linear equations such as: linear maps such as: and their representations in vector spaces and through matrices. Linear algebra is central to almost all areas of mathematics.

This program also makes use of NumPy to calculate the inverse of the matrix, rather than use hand-by-hand code that may be inefficient for much larger matrices.

## NumPy
- NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays
